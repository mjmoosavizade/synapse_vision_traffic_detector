    # List of class names that your ONNX model was trained on.
    # The order of these names MUST EXACTLY MATCH the order provided by the model's .pt file.
    # (As retrieved using the 'model.names' attribute).
    # This model has 34 classes.

    # Confidence threshold for detections (ranging from 0.0 to 1.0).
    # Detections with a confidence score below this value will be discarded.
    # Adjust this value to filter out weaker detections (e.g., 0.25 is a common starting point).
    confidence_threshold: 0.25

    # Non-Maximum Suppression (NMS) threshold for overlapping bounding boxes (ranging from 0.0 to 1.0).
    # NMS helps remove redundant boxes detecting the same object.
    # A higher value means more overlap is tolerated; a lower value means more aggressive suppression.
    nms_threshold: 0.45

    # Input dimensions that the ONNX model expects.
    # These values MUST EXACTLY MATCH the 'img_size' you used during the ONNX export process.
    # For YOLOv8, this is commonly 640 for both width and height.
